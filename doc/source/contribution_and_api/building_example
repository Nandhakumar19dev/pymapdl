Building an example
===================


To run the documentation, you need to have the correct versions of each tools. To do so, execute the following instruction.

.. code:: bash

    pip install -r requirements/requirements_docs.txt


The Sphinx configuration is in the file ``conf.py`` in ``doc/source``.

To run the sphinx tool:

.. code:: bash

    doc\make.bat html



There are three types of examples: dynamic, static, and semi-static.


Dynamic examples
----------------

They are based on Python files and must be run under 3 minutes.

They are in the ``examples`` directory inside this repository.

Example: https://github.com/pyansys/pymapdl/blob/main/examples/00-mapdl-examples/2d_plate_with_a_hole.py

It is published on the following link: 
`MAPDL 2D Plane Stress Concentration Analysis <https://mapdl.docs.pyansys.com/examples/gallery_examples/00-mapdl-examples/2d_plate_with_a_hole.html#sphx-glr-examples-gallery-examples-00-mapdl-examples-2d-plate-with-a-hole-py>`_

They will be executed and the mention **Total running time of the script** will appear at the end of the document.


Static examples
---------------

They are based on RST files and will not be executed. 

They are in the ``doc\source`` directory.

Example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyansys/pymapdl/main/doc/source/examples/extended_examples/Krylov/krylov_example.rst

It is published on the following link: `Harmonic analysis using the frequency-sweep Krylov method <https://mapdl.docs.pyansys.com/examples/extended_examples/Krylov/krylov_example.html>`_


Semi-dynamic examples
---------------------

They are RST files which execute Python code.

Example:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyansys/pymapdl/main/doc/source/examples/technology_showcase_examples/techdemo-28/ex_28-tecfricstir.rst

It is visible at the following link: `Friction Stir Welding (FSW) Simulation <https://mapdl.docs.pyansys.com/examples/technology_showcase_examples/techdemo-28/ex_28-tecfricstir.html>`_
